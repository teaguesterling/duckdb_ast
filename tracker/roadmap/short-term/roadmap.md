# Short-term Roadmap (Next 1-2 months)

## Immediate Priorities

### 1. Additional Language Support (2-3 weeks)
Start with the most requested languages:
- JavaScript/TypeScript support
- C/C++ support  
- Basic test coverage for each

### 2. Performance Optimizations (1 week)
- Profile current implementation
- Optimize tree traversal
- Add caching for repeated file parsing
- Benchmark against large codebases

### 3. Enhanced Name Extraction (1 week)
- Extract names from more node types
- Handle language-specific naming patterns
- Add qualified names (e.g., Class.method)

### 4. Documentation and Examples (1 week)
- Comprehensive README with examples
- Blog post about the extension
- Example queries for common use cases
- Performance tuning guide

## Success Metrics
- Support for at least 3 languages total
- Parse 1000+ file repository in < 10 seconds
- 95%+ test coverage
- Published to DuckDB extension registry
