# Long-term Vision (6-12 months)

## Goal
Make DuckDB the premier tool for code analysis at scale, enabling SQL-based querying of entire codebases.

## Major Features

### 1. Advanced Code Intelligence
- **AST Type System**: Custom types for AST nodes with methods
- **Pattern Matching**: SQL-based code pattern detection
- **Code Metrics**: Built-in functions for complexity, coupling, etc.
- **Dependency Analysis**: Track imports, calls, and dependencies

### 2. Multi-Repository Analysis  
- Query across multiple repositories
- Support for git history analysis
- Code evolution tracking
- Cross-repository dependency graphs

### 3. Language Ecosystem
- Support 10+ major programming languages
- Language-agnostic query patterns
- Custom language plugin system
- Handle polyglot codebases

### 4. Integration & Tooling
- VS Code extension for AST queries
- CI/CD integration for code quality gates  
- Export to visualization tools
- REST API server mode

### 5. Performance at Scale
- Incremental parsing for large repos
- Distributed processing support
- AST index persistence
- Sub-second queries on million-line codebases

## Use Case Examples
```sql
-- Find all TODO comments with high-complexity functions
WITH complex_functions AS (
    SELECT file_path, name, node_id
    FROM ast_functions('**/*.py', 'python') 
    WHERE cyclomatic_complexity() > 10
)
SELECT c.file_path, c.name, t.source_text
FROM read_ast('**/*.py', 'python') t
JOIN complex_functions c ON t.file_path = c.file_path
WHERE t.type = 'comment' AND t.source_text LIKE '%TODO%'
  AND t.start_line BETWEEN c.start_line AND c.end_line;

-- Track API evolution
SELECT 
    version,
    COUNT(*) as public_api_count,
    COUNT(*) - LAG(COUNT(*)) OVER (ORDER BY version) as api_change
FROM ast_git_history('src/api.py', 'python', 'v1.0', 'HEAD')
WHERE type = 'function_definition' 
  AND is_public_api(name)
GROUP BY version;
```

## Success Metrics
- Adopted by 100+ organizations
- 1M+ downloads
- Active contributor community
- Integrated into popular development tools
