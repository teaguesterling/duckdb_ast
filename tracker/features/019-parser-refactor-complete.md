# Parser Ownership Refactor - COMPLETE

## Summary
Successfully refactored the DuckDB AST extension to have proper parser ownership and integrated the KIND taxonomy system.

## Major Achievements

### 1. Parser Ownership Model ✅
- Each LanguageHandler now owns its TSParser instance
- Lazy initialization pattern implemented
- Fixed double-delete segfaults by removing manual `ts_parser_delete` calls
- Parser lifetime tied to handler lifetime

### 2. KIND Taxonomy Integration ✅
- Implemented 4-bit KIND encoding (16 semantic categories)
- Added universal flags (is_keyword, is_punctuation, is_builtin, is_public)
- Created 64-bit semantic ID for cross-language identity
- Updated ASTNode structure with nested field organization

### 3. SQL Macro System Refactor ✅
- Worked around DuckDB's limitation of not passing lambdas to macros
- Separated indexing (`ast_with_indices`) from filtering
- Users now use `list_filter` with full lambda support
- Created specialized filters for common cases (`ast_filter_by_type`, etc.)
- Auto-generated short names for all macros

### 4. Performance Improvements ✅
- Implemented O(1) descendant counting using DFS traversal properties
- Removed O(n²) descendant calculation
- Fixed bounds checking issues in subtree extraction

### 5. Architecture Improvements ✅
- Added high-level `ParseFile()` interface to language handlers
- Cleaned up virtual method usage
- Better separation of concerns between parsing and node extraction

## Technical Details

### Parser Ownership Pattern
```cpp
class LanguageHandler {
protected:
    mutable TSParser* parser = nullptr;
    
    TSParser* GetParser() const {
        if (!parser) InitializeParser();
        return parser;
    }
    
    virtual void InitializeParser() const = 0;
};
```

### SQL Macro Pattern
```sql
-- Old (doesn't work):
ast_get_branches(ast, node -> node.type = 'function')

-- New (works):
ast_update(ast, ast_extract_subtrees(ast.nodes,
    list_filter(ast_with_indices(ast.nodes), x -> x.node.type = 'function')
))
```

### O(1) Descendant Counting
```cpp
// When returning to a node in DFS traversal:
descendant_count = nodes.size() - entry.node_index - 1;
```

## Bugs Fixed
- Double-delete segfault in read_ast_objects
- Incorrect descendant counts causing out-of-bounds access
- Parser cleanup issues in error paths

## Next Steps
- Implement ParseFile for remaining language handlers
- Add smart pointer wrappers (tracked as feature #018)
- Test full taxonomy features with real queries
- Update read_ast_objects to return new AST struct format
